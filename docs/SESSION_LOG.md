# Session log

One entry per working session, newest at the bottom. Append, never rewrite.

The point of this file is that a session ending mid-phase should be resumable
by someone with no memory of it — including you, three weeks later. The "next
command" line is the most important line in every entry; if it is vague the
entry has failed.

**Format:**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <phase>, <one-line summary>

**Built:**      what changed, by file or package
**Measured:**   numbers produced from runs IN THIS SESSION only
**Unverified:** written but not observed working
**Open:**       questions, blockers, decisions deferred
**Next:**       the exact command to run
```

`Measured` and `Unverified` are separate fields on purpose. Anything that has
not been observed working goes in `Unverified`, no matter how confident the
code looks. M6 is currently open precisely because a fix was written into the
approach window without a run behind it.

---

## 2026-08-06 — state at the start of M7

**Built:**
M0–M6 complete as source. Eight packages. `coco_mission` composes the full
stack. `traverse_demo.py` sequences the seven-step fetch.

**Measured:**
- M0: sim RTF ≈ 1.0, every sensor at nominal rate, in sim time
- M2: Nav2 + SmacPlanner2D, 10/10 goals, mean 34.7 s, 36.3 m, home to 12 cm,
  paths 6.2 % shorter than Dijkstra
- M3: `arm_ik` 20,000/20,000 round trips, max error 1.7e-16 m, 1.5 µs/solve;
  MoveIt pick-and-place 4/4 at the tuned target
- M3: `--target` re-targeting 5/14 with the magnet grasp; failures split
  cleanly on x, every point ≥ 0.1505 completes, every point ≤ 0.1468 rejected
- M4: five-stage curriculum, 10/10 deterministic at both 18° and 24°,
  126–127 steps, returns 69.5–69.9; re-verified 10/10 after ramp rebuild
  without retraining
- M4: `--fast` A/B, same seed and config — with: 531/533 tipped, eval 0/10;
  without: 0/533 tipped, eval 10/10, and faster (8.7 vs 8.2 steps/s)
- M5: perception 16/16 lane × station cells within ±2 mm vs `gz model -p`
- M6: bare policy at yaw 0 drifts +0.03 m over 2.5 m in every lane
- M6: `lateral_hold` at K_Y 3.0 / K_YAW 2.5 takes worst-case drift to
  0.053 m, 8/8 summits, no retraining
- Tests: 250, 0 failures
- Training throughput ceiling: ~8.6–8.7 env-steps/s

**Unverified:**
- **M6 end-to-end fetch has never completed.** Best run reached step 4 and
  failed at grasp approach, stopping at base-x 0.1443 — inside the measured
  self-collision bound of 0.150.
- The corrected approach window `[0.1510, 0.1565]` is **written and unit
  tested but never run in simulation**.
- CI workflow and Dockerfile have never executed (no Docker or runner on
  this machine).

**Open:**
- ~111 commits unpushed; `origin` has only `main`.
- `FUTURE_WORK.md` 9(b): the 12° full-distance stage evaluates 0/10 alone —
  a greedy stall at 4.34 m, reproducible to within 0.02 of return.
  `MIN_LIN = 0.15` sitting between a 0.10 m/s timeout and a 0.17 m/s finish
  is the leading suspect. Unexplained.
- `gazebo_models/scripts/` and `coco_moveit_config/scripts/` have no linters;
  ~118 docstring and import-order findings remain.

**Next:**
Phase 0. One blue fetch on the v1 world, fresh simulator:

```bash
ros2 launch gazebo_models full_world_robo.launch.py traverse:=true gui:=false
ros2 launch coco_mission mission.launch.py \
    policy:=~/coco_rl_runs/curriculum_20260726_211008/phase5_24deg_s0p0.zip
ros2 run gazebo_models traverse_demo.py --colour blue
```

Report the base-x the creep phase achieved and whether `/grasp/pick` planned.

---

## 2026-08-06 — Phase 0, M6 closes: the fetch completes end to end

**Built:**
No source changes. Docs only: the end-to-end result in `docs/RESULTS.md`,
the `policy:=` command corrected to an absolute path in `docs/RUNNING.md`,
the M6 row in `README.md`, and this entry.

**Measured** (all from one run in this session, v1 wedge world, fresh
simulator, `gui:=false`, never `--fast`):
- **`FETCH COMPLETE — blue delivered`.** All seven steps, 230.9 s from the
  first log line to the last, home to within 0.06 m of the start.
- **base-x 0.1544** reported by `approach_server` against the window
  `[0.1510, 0.1565]` — +3.4 mm above the near bound, −2.1 mm below the far
  one, +0.7 mm off the 0.15375 centre. The previous attempt's 0.1443 was
  5.7 mm *below* `GRASP_SELF_COLLISION_X`; this is 4.8 mm above it.
- **base-x 0.1548 by Gazebo ground truth** — robot at world
  (3.89573, 0.26346) yaw −0.08396, `target_blue` at (4.049990, 0.250000),
  giving (0.1548, −0.0005) in `base_footprint`. Agrees with the
  dead-reckoned estimate to 0.45 mm in x, 0.48 mm in y.
- **`/grasp/pick` planned and held**: `outcome=held`, `lifted=1`, grasp
  `[0.2728, 0.5052]`, hover `[-0.1054, 0.2935]`.
- **Lift 34.8 mm** (z 0.7288 → 0.7636), read from Gazebo. Place confirmed
  at z 0.0790, `target_blue` ending at world (−1.909110, −0.054373).
- Climb `outcome=goal`, 60 steps, progress 4.72, **lateral +0.09** with the
  lane hold on. Descent `outcome=goal`, 322 steps, progress 6.65.
- Arbiter trace `idle → nav → rl → idle → approach → idle → rl → nav →
  idle`, no double-publisher warning at any point.
- Tests: **250, 0 failures, 0 skipped** (57/67/50/44/20/12). A bare
  `colcon test-result` said 266 — the stale-XML inflation already noted in
  RESULTS.md; the per-package current files sum to 250.
- Bringup gates all passed first time: `verify_sim.py` all checks passed,
  four controllers active, all 4 magnets released, `bt_navigator` active.

**Unverified:**
- **Repeatability. This is 1/1 for blue, not a success rate.** No colour
  other than blue has been driven end to end, and no run has been repeated.
- CI workflow and Dockerfile still have never executed here.
- No video recorded — the run was headless. Still open from the M7_DESIGN
  precondition list.

**Open:**
- `ramp_driver` has **no `os.path.expanduser`** on its `model` parameter,
  and bash does not tilde-expand after `:=`. The documented
  `policy:=~/coco_rl_runs/...` (see the previous entry's Next block, left
  intact as the historical record) reaches `PPO.load` as a literal `~` and
  raises inside the climb worker, surfacing as a failed `/ramp/climb`. The
  docs now use the absolute path; the one-line code fix is NOT done.
- Untracked and therefore unpushed: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/M7_DESIGN.md`,
  `docs/M7_PHASES.md`, `docs/README_BANNER_snippet.md`. They exist only on
  this machine. Committing them is a call for the repo owner.
- `FUTURE_WORK.md` 9(b) unchanged: 12° full-distance evaluates 0/10 alone,
  a reproducible greedy stall at 4.34 m.
- `gazebo_models/scripts/` and `coco_moveit_config/scripts/` still unlinted.

**Next:**
M6 is closed, so M7 is unblocked. Phase 1 of `docs/M7_PHASES.md` — the
MuJoCo throughput baseline. The figure to beat is 8.7 env-steps/s, and the
instruction is to stop and report if MuJoCo is not meaningfully faster.

Before anything else, re-read that block. Then:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/setup_env.sh
cd ~/ros2_ws && colcon test --packages-select coco_rl && colcon test-result
```

To re-run the M6 fetch instead (fresh simulator, absolute policy path):

```bash
bash ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/gazebo_models/scripts/ros_clean.sh
ros2 launch gazebo_models full_world_robo.launch.py traverse:=true gui:=false
ros2 launch coco_mission mission.launch.py \
    policy:=/home/gautham/coco_rl_runs/curriculum_20260726_211008/phase5_24deg_s0p0.zip
ros2 run gazebo_models traverse_demo.py --colour blue
```

---

## 2026-08-06 — Phase 0.5, M6 consolidated: 19/20, and the drift explained

**Built:**
No source changes; docs only. Phase 0.5 block added to `M7_PHASES.md`;
`CLAUDE.md` and `M7_DESIGN.md` brought into the tree; `README_BANNER_snippet.md`
deleted; `FUTURE_WORK.md` 7b and 8b added. The 20-run harness, the
ground-truth/AMCL logger and the analysers live in the job scratch dir,
deliberately outside the repo.

**Measured** (20 runs, 5 per colour, fresh simulator each, headless, never
`--fast`):
- **19/20 complete.** red 5/5, green 5/5, yellow 5/5, blue 4/5.
- **Approach: 20/20 inside `[0.1510, 0.1565]`.** Ground truth 0.1534–0.1556,
  mean 0.1543, **sd 0.6 mm**. Reported 0.1530–0.1547. |truth − reported|
  0.05–0.92 mm, mean 0.53 mm.
- **Grasp held 20/20**, lift 33.9–35.9 mm from Gazebo ground truth.
- Vision confirmed the requested colour **20/20**.
- Run durations 116.7–322.5 s.
- **Drift at summit** +0.020 to +0.280 m, mean +0.081, sd 0.072. Exceeds the
  documented 0.053 m worst case in **9/20**; max is **5.3×** it. Positive in
  all 20 runs. Per lane: red +0.034, green +0.058, blue +0.086, yellow +0.146.
- **Entry heading at `/ramp/climb`** |yaw| 0.104–0.472 rad, mean 0.290,
  **outside Nav2's `yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.25` in 14/20** — settled, not
  transient (Δyaw over the next second = 0.0000 in all 20; stationary for the
  prior 2 s in 12 of the 14).
- **AMCL is not the cause**: |ground-truth yaw − AMCL yaw| 0.006–0.165 rad,
  mean 0.076; the two disagree about tolerance compliance in 1 run of 20.
- Drift vs entry heading: Pearson **r = +0.565** (r² = 0.32); fit
  drift = 0.132·yaw₀ + 0.073.
- **Lane offset at the summit** −0.012 to +0.301 m. Two runs finished more
  than a half-lane off centre: run 16 at y +1.0512 (**0.199 m from the
  platform edge**), run 19 at y +0.5041 (nearer yellow's lane than blue's,
  and colour-based selection is what kept it correct).
- **AMCL gap at descent end** 0.119–1.183 m, mean 0.378. Every run ≤ 0.470 m
  drove home; the single 1.183 m run did not.
- Tests: **250, 0 failures, 0 skipped** — unchanged.

**Unverified:**
- **Nothing is pushed.** `gh auth status` still reports no host despite the
  task stating `gh auth login` had been run; `~/.config/gh` does not exist.
- **No video.** `ffmpeg` is not installed and `sudo` needs a password.
- The mechanism behind the yaw-tolerance breach (FUTURE_WORK 8b) — candidates
  listed, none tested.
- The residual +y drift bias — observed in all 20 runs, unexplained.

**Open:**
- Two blockers above, both needing the operator: `gh auth login`, and
  `sudo apt install ffmpeg`.
- FUTURE_WORK 7b: 1/20 of the mission is lost to the deliberately unmapped
  corridor, after a successful pick. Mapping it is probably cheaper than
  tuning AMCL.
- `ramp_driver` still has no `os.path.expanduser` on its `model` parameter.
- The lane-hold gains were deliberately NOT retuned.

**Next:**
Land the two blocked deliverables, in this order:

```bash
gh auth login                                  # operator
git -C ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2 push -u origin jazzy-harmonic-port
git -C ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2 ls-remote --heads origin
```

Then the video (needs `sudo apt install ffmpeg`), then M7 Phase 1 — the
MuJoCo throughput baseline in `docs/M7_PHASES.md`. The figure to beat is
8.7 env-steps/s, and the instruction there is to stop and report if MuJoCo
is not meaningfully faster.

---

## 2026-08-07 — Phase 0.6: pushed, cross-track fixed, the +y bias is the policy

**Built:**
First source change of these phases, and it is confined to reporting:
`ramp_driver` now publishes `lateral` as signed distance from the **target
lane centreline** and keeps the old quantity as `disp`. It takes ground
truth from `/model/coco/odometry` and the lane from
`/mission/target_colour` via `coco_config`'s colour→lane table, with a
`lane_y` parameter for standalone runs. **`ramp_env` is untouched** —
`obs[1]` is a policy input and redefining it would have broken the shipped
policy and every number measured against it. `lateral_hold`'s control
input is unchanged and the gains were not retuned.

Also: `docs/RESULTS.md` and `docs/FUTURE_WORK.md` 7b/8b/9(a) amended;
diagnostics and the fetch-matrix harness live in the job scratch dir,
outside the repo.

**Measured** (this session):
- **Cross-track, recomputed over the 20 logged runs — no new simulation.**
  Recomputed `disp` reproduces the logged `lateral` to **0.0050 m**, which
  is the status line's own 2 dp quantisation, so the recomputation is
  sound. `disp` mean +0.0814 / max +0.2793; **cross-track mean +0.1203 /
  max +0.3012**. Mean error was understated by 0.039 m (~48 %).
- **The old metric ranked the lanes backwards.** By `disp`: red +0.0344
  (best) → yellow +0.1472. By cross-track: blue +0.0592 (best), red
  **+0.1249** (second worst), yellow +0.2099. Red arrives +0.127 m
  off-lane and then barely drifts.
- **The +y bias is the policy, not the machine.** Open loop (constant
  `linear.x`, `angular.z` = 0, no policy), 3 trials over **10.05 m**:
  lateral **+0.0000 m**, yaw change **0.00000 rad**. Bare policy, same
  lane: **+0.3115 / +0.3107 m over 6.13 m** (≈ +50.8 mm/m). Bare policy
  teleported to **exactly yaw 0** on the ramp: **+0.0452 / +0.0452 /
  +0.0438 / +0.0438 m** in lanes +0.75 / +0.25 / −0.25 / −0.75 — same sign
  and magnitude on both sides of the centreline. The bias follows the
  robot, not the lane.
- Tests: **253, 0 failures, 0 skipped** (up from 250; `coco_rl` 50 → 53).

**Corrected** (both errors were mine, in text committed last session):
- "Every run ≤ 0.470 m got home" was **circular** — 0.470066 m is simply
  the largest AMCL gap among the successes, so it was true by
  construction. The data brackets the threshold to **(0.470, 1.183) m with
  nothing sampled between**, and supports no stronger claim.
- The half-lane count was **three** runs, not two: run 20 (+0.2581) was
  missed alongside 16 (+0.3012) and 19 (+0.2541).

**Unverified:**
- **No demo video.** See below — it is a tooling gap, not a failed run.
- The bias rate is ~2.5× larger on the flat (50.8 mm/m) than on the grade
  (20.2 mm/m). Unexplained.
- The mechanism behind Nav2 finishing legs outside its own
  `yaw_goal_tolerance` (FUTURE_WORK 8b) is still untested.

**Open:**
- **The video needs a window-manager tool.** `wmctrl` and `xdotool` are
  both absent and `sudo` needs a password. Without one, the Gazebo GUI and
  RViz cannot be placed or raised, so they open behind the fullscreen
  terminal and `x11grab` records the terminal instead of the robot. The
  first attempt was aborted the moment a layout probe showed this, and the
  capture was deleted rather than kept. `~/.gz/sim/8/gui.config` was
  temporarily resized to 952×1000 and has been restored to its original
  1000×845.
- Pushed to **`GauthamCodes/coco-robot-jazzy-2.0` (private)**, a *new*
  repo, as instructed. `origin` (coco-robot-ros2) is untouched and still
  carries only `main` at 34f151c.
- `ramp_driver` still has no `os.path.expanduser` on its `model` parameter.

**Next:**
For the video, one of:

```bash
sudo apt install wmctrl        # then I can tile and raise both windows
```

— or arrange the Gazebo GUI and RViz side by side by hand and say when
they are placed. Otherwise, M7 Phase 1, the MuJoCo throughput baseline:

```bash
source ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/setup_env.sh
sed -n '/## Phase 1/,/^```$/p' ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/docs/M7_PHASES.md
```

The figure to beat is 8.7 env-steps/s, and that block says to stop and
report if MuJoCo is not meaningfully faster.

---

## 2026-08-07 — Phase 0.5/0.6 closed, history rewritten, published

**Built:**
No new features. History rewritten with `git-filter-repo`, the demo video
published as a release asset, README gains a video link and an attribution
line. Phases 0.5 and 0.6 are closed.

**The rewrite — what it did and did not touch.** Blobs only; **no commit
message was modified**. Two things removed: the 5 `.pyc` blobs that should
never have been committed, and `/home/akshayr2003` (a third party's home
path, present in history but not in the working tree), replaced with
`/home/user`. The superseded `gautham@gmail.com` was replaced with
`gauthamanil888@gmail.com` so the identity is consistent.

Deliberately **kept**: the 106 `Co-Authored-By` trailers and the 26
`Claude-Session:` URL trailers. Both were flagged before the rewrite and
the decision was to leave existing history alone and simply stop adding
trailers from now on. Anyone minding the session URLs being public should
know they are there.

**Verified before pushing** (all six, on the rewritten branch):
- `akshayr2003` anywhere in history: **0**
- authors: **only `GauthamCodes <gauthamanil888@gmail.com>`**
- `.pyc` anywhere in history: **0** (was 5)
- commit count: **128 → 128** (`--prune-empty=never`; no commit touched
  only `.pyc`, so none could have been pruned anyway)
- tracked content vs the pre-rewrite tip: **exactly 2 changed lines in 2
  files**, both `maintainer_email` — i.e. only the intended replacement.
  Note the HEAD *tree* SHA did change (`51af1444` → `137d38c9`), which is
  expected: the email replacement edits tracked files, so byte-identity
  was never achievable and "unchanged tree hash" was the wrong check.
- `colcon build` clean, tests **253 / 0 / 0**

**Published:**
- Public repo `coco-robot-ros2`, branch `jazzy-harmonic-port` at `82a2297`.
  **`main` untouched, still `34f151c`.**
- Private mirror `coco-robot-jazzy-2.0` force-updated to the same SHA;
  local, origin and jazzy2 all agree.
- Release `m6-fetch-demo` with `coco_fetch_demo.mp4` (1920×1004, 75.28 s,
  936 kbps, 8.8 MB). Not in git. Also at `~/Videos/coco_fetch_demo.mp4`.

**Backup — keep this.** `~/coco-backup-20260807-0543.bundle` (4,731,170
bytes), `git bundle verify` reported *"is okay"* and *"records a complete
history"* before anything was rewritten. Pre-rewrite ref state is beside it
in `~/coco-backup-20260807-0543.refs.txt`; the old tip was `d270e77`.

**Measured across Phases 0.5–0.6** (carried forward, all from those runs):
19/20 fetches complete; approach inside the 5.5 mm window **20/20**
(sd 0.6 mm); grasp held **20/20**, lifts 33.9–35.9 mm; cross-track at the
summit mean **+0.120 m**, max **+0.301 m**; entry heading outside Nav2's
own `yaw_goal_tolerance` in **14/20**; constant policy bias **+0.045 m**
with open-loop drive measuring **+0.0000 m** over 10.05 m.

**Unexplained, and this is the honest headline:** the **majority of mission
cross-track drift has no established cause**. The constant policy bias
accounts for ~15 % of the 0.301 m worst case; entry heading covers some
further part at r² = 0.32; the remainder — including the arrival offset of
up to +0.158 m the robot inherits at the ramp foot — is unattributed. Also
open: why Nav2 finishes legs outside its own yaw tolerance (not AMCL error
— estimate and truth agree to 0.076 rad), and why the policy bias rate is
~2.5× larger on the flat than on the grade.

**Next:**
M7 Phase 1 — the MuJoCo throughput baseline. `coco_config` does **not**
currently hold wheel radius, track or masses (they live in the xacro and
`coco_controllers.yaml`), so generating an MJCF "from coco_config" requires
adding them there first, with a test pinning them to the xacro.

```bash
sed -n '/## Phase 1/,/^```$/p' ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/docs/M7_PHASES.md
```

---

## 2026-08-07 — M7 Phase 1: MuJoCo throughput and the fidelity gap

**Built:**
- `coco_config.robot` gains the base physics constants — `WHEEL_RADIUS`,
  `WHEEL_WIDTH`, `WHEEL_MASS`, `WHEEL_SEPARATION`, `WHEELBASE`,
  `CHASSIS_MASS`, `CHASSIS_SIZE`, `WHEEL_SEPARATION_MULTIPLIER` — each with
  its provenance. They were readable only from the xacro and
  `coco_controllers.yaml` before, which was tenable with one simulator and
  is not with two. `test_base_matches_urdf.py` pins them to both sources,
  including deriving the track from where the wheel joints actually sit
  rather than trusting the typed parameter.
- **`coco_sim`** (ament_python): generates the MJCF from those constants.
  `test_mjcf_traces_to_config` rebuilds with a monkeypatched constant and
  asserts the model changed, plus a guard asserting an *unused* constant
  leaves it unchanged — together they make "generated from coco_config" a
  fact rather than a comment.
- **`coco_rl/coco_rl/mujoco_env.py`**: Gymnasium env, shape-identical to
  `ramp_env` (`Box(-1,1,(2,))` action, 8-dim obs, `STEP_DT` 0.1,
  `MAX_LIN` 0.4 / `MAX_ANG` 0.5). Zero `rclpy`, enforced by a hostile test
  that strips ROS from `sys.modules` and poisons `__import__`, with a
  further test asserting the guard itself still raises.

**Measured** (this session, this machine):
- **Throughput**: 1 / 4 / 8 / 12 workers → **805 / 2,126 / 2,791 / 2,826**
  steps/s. Peak **2,826 = 325×** Gazebo's 8.7. Inside M7_DESIGN §5.1's
  2,000–6,000 target, at the low end.
- Scaling **saturates at 8 workers** (8 → 12 buys 1.3 % on 12 cores).
- `SubprocVecEnv` at 1 worker (805) is **slower** than in-process (1,026):
  IPC costs ~22 %, so it only pays from 2 workers up.
- **Attribution, not assertion**: raw `mj_step` = 100,401 physics/s =
  **1,004** control-step equivalents; full env step = **1,026**. They agree
  to ~2 %, so the env loop costs nothing measurable. Combined with the v1
  A/B (8.7 without `--fast`, 8.2 with — unlocking physics made it *worse*),
  the ~118× single-process gain is almost entirely **the removal of the ROS
  round trip**, not MuJoCo's solver. Multiprocessing adds the rest.
- **Fidelity**, identical open-loop sequence, 10 s, ground truth both sides:
  straight leg **0.0779 m error over 1.9874 m (3.9 %)** with yaw matched to
  **0.02°**; arc leg **1.0959 m** and **1.2015 rad (68.8°)**.

**Unverified / unexplained:**
- **Turning does not transfer, and the obvious explanation is wrong.** The
  `wheel_separation_multiplier: 1.10` predicts a yaw ratio of 1.10; the
  measured ratio is **2.902**. Both simulators under-turn a commanded
  2.5 rad (Gazebo 1.833, MuJoCo 0.632) as a skid-steer should, but disagree
  by 2.9×. The remaining ~2.6× is **unexplained**; contact modelling is the
  leading candidate per M7_DESIGN §5.3. **Not tuned** — Phase 1 states the
  divergence, §5.3's calibration is where it gets closed.
- Consequence for Phase 2: straight-line dynamics transfer well enough to
  train against; anything depending on commanded yaw tracking — including
  §4.3's cross-track reward term — will not, until contact is calibrated.
- The MJCF is base-only (no arm, no sensors, no meshes) and its inertias are
  primitive-shape approximations carrying the xacro's masses.
- Carried forward, still open: the majority of mission cross-track drift
  remains unattributed; why Nav2 finishes legs outside its own yaw
  tolerance.

**Open:**
- `mujoco` 3.11.0 and `git-filter-repo` 2.47.0 are `pip --user` installs,
  not in any package manifest. `coco_sim`/`mujoco_env` will not build on a
  machine without them.
- History backup bundle kept at `~/coco-backup-20260807-0543.bundle`.

**Next:**
M7 Phase 2 — The Yard, per `docs/M7_PHASES.md`. Before any policy training,
§5.3's contact calibration is now a stated precondition rather than an
optional step, because of the 2.9× yaw divergence above.

## 2026-08-07 — Phase 1.5: contact calibration, and a Phase 1 number corrected

**Corrected:** the "2.9× yaw divergence" reported in the Phase 1 entry was
roughly half harness error. `fidelity_mujoco.py` sent a **normalised**
action (0.5, scaled by `MAX_ANG` → 0.25 rad/s); `fidelity_gazebo.py`
published a **raw** twist (0.5 rad/s). The two simulators were driven at
different yaw rates. Compared against commanded rather than against each
other, the real gap was ~1.45×. Everything in Phase 1.5 commands both
sides in rad/s.

**Built:**
- Calibrated contact in `coco_sim/mjcf.py`: sliding friction 0.7 → **0.4**,
  `solref` 0.02 → **0.1**, `solimp` d0 0.9 → **0.5**.
- `mujoco_env` now applies `WHEEL_SEPARATION_MULTIPLIER` in its IK, which
  is parity with the deployed `diff_drive_controller` rather than a tuning
  knob — the same `cmd_vel` must mean the same motion in both.
- `M7_DESIGN.md` §2.5 gains a **yaw-gain randomisation term, 0.70–1.45**;
  §5.3 gains the line that transfer is bought by making the policy
  insensitive to steering authority, not by making the engines agree.
- `coco_sim` now declares `mujoco==3.11.0` in `setup.py` and records it in
  `package.xml` (no rosdep key exists). Pinned because the contact fit is
  against 3.11.0's solver.

**Measured:**
- Yaw sweep, 7 magnitudes × both signs, both simulators.
- Gap **worst at the smallest commands**: 1.711× at 0.05 rad, i.e. exactly
  the lane-hold band — and roughly constant proportional loss, not a slip
  nonlinearity (MuJoCo loses ~40 % even at 0.01 rad/s).
- **Calibrated: worst deviation 1.707× → 1.274×.** Target of 1.3× met.
- **Straight-line improved**: 4.1 % → **2.8 %** of distance over 5 s.
- Three hypotheses tested and two killed: anisotropic friction (refuted at
  source — the xacro is isotropic `mu1=mu2=0.7`, no `fdir1`, and warns
  against anisotropy in DART); torsional friction (`condim=3` moved
  achieved yaw 60.6 % → 60.7 %); actuator tracking (servos deliver 98.8 %
  of the commanded wheel-speed difference). The cause is skid-steer scrub,
  and **sliding friction is a weak lever on it** (0.2 → 1.5 moves
  efficiency only 59.5 % → 65.2 %) while contact softness is the strong one.
- **Gazebo is not self-consistent above 1 rad**: its own +/− asymmetry is
  ≤1.014 up to 1.0 rad, 1.174 at 1.5, and **1.361 at 2.5** — larger than
  the 1.3× tolerance being targeted. Comparisons use the magnitude average
  and say so.

**Unverified / open:**
- Residual 1.27×–0.86× is **not closed**, by choice: friction is a weak
  lever and the reference disagrees with itself at the top of the range, so
  further tuning would fit one yaw rate and degrade the model elsewhere.
  Handled by randomisation instead.
- Single Gazebo run per sweep point. At 1.5 and 2.5 rad the sign spread
  exceeds the difference being measured, so those rows are approximate;
  repeats not run.
- Calibration is on a flat plane only. The Yard's grades and heightfields
  are a different contact regime and are not covered by this fit.
- Carried forward: the majority of mission cross-track drift is still
  unattributed; Nav2 still finishes legs outside its own yaw tolerance.

**Next:**
M7 Phase 2 — The Yard, per `docs/M7_PHASES.md`. The contact calibration
that Phase 1 flagged as a precondition is now done for flat ground.

## 2026-08-09 — M7 Phase 2: The Yard in both simulators, and three closeout checks

**Built:**
- `coco_sim/worlds/yard_params.yaml` — the single source of Yard geometry.
  Every rescaled value carries `spec:`, `value:` and `derivation:`.
- `coco_sim/coco_sim/yard.py` — one generator, two engines. Analytic
  `height(x, y)` is the sole truth; both the MJCF and the SDF are emitted
  from the same `features()` list; heightfield STLs written on MuJoCo's own
  triangulation diagonal, which was **measured** rather than assumed.
- `coco_sim/coco_sim/probes.py` — where parity probes go and why there.
- `coco_rl/coco_rl/yard_env.py` — full §2.5 randomisation, applied to a
  compiled model **in place** (no per-episode recompile), reproducible from
  a seed alone.
- `gazebo_models/worlds/coco_yard.world` + `meshes/yard/*.stl`, generated.
  **`coco_world.world` untouched.**
- Tests: **335 passing** (was 250). `coco_sim` 42, `coco_rl` 93,
  `coco_config` 70. The 6 remaining failures are `flake8`/`pep257`/
  `copyright` in `custom_teleop` and `coco_perception` — **pre-existing**,
  verified by re-running them on a stashed tree; neither package was
  touched this session.

**Measured:**
- **Cross-engine parity 0.242 mm worst case** over 264 plumb-bob probes
  dropped in both engines, of which 0.197–0.201 mm is a *constant*
  compliance offset present on flat ground too — **geometric parity is
  0.138 mm**. Concave features genuinely entered: the bridge void drops the
  full 0.650 m in both engines; troughs, depressions and the under-deck
  cavity all agree.
- **Yard throughput at 8 workers: 2,287 / 2,222 / 751 steps/s** on routes
  A / B / C. **Route C is 3.0× more expensive** (the rubble heightfield);
  still above the 500 steps/s stop threshold.
- **Per-route feasibility:** A completable (24/25 at ≤0.65 throttle), B
  marginal (caps at 15/25, friction-limited), C completable but
  throttle-sensitive (23/25 at 0.35, 8/25 at full). A and C fall
  monotonically with throttle, B is flat — torque-limited vs
  friction-limited, cleanly separated.
- **The curb: the spec's 60 mm needs 1.00 m/s, which is 2.5× `MAX_LIN`.**
  Not mountable as this robot is commanded. The built 28 mm needs 0.35 m/s
  (88 % of maximum), and is unmountable at μ = 0.6 — the bottom of Route
  C's own range.
- **Calibration conditioning:** not flat (span 0.113 over μ ∈ [0.30, 0.50],
  9.3 % of the fitted score) and the fitted μ = 0.40 is **not** the
  optimum — μ = 0.30 scores better.

**Found and fixed (defects in already-committed work):**
- `CAMERA_MASS = 0.040` mislabelled; the extra 10 g was the **IMU**. Root
  cause was a test regex that did not handle self-closing `<link/>` tags
  and swallowed the next link's mass. Split, parser fixed, guard added.
- **Neither MuJoCo env limited acceleration**, while the deployed
  controller ramps at 2.0 m/s². Caused wheelies that read as "grippy
  ground is hard to climb". Wired in `yard_env`.
- `torque_scale` scaled `gainprm` but not `biasprm` — a **speed** scale,
  not a torque scale.
- A **curb overhang of my own design** that made the curb unclimbable at
  any speed. Found by the probes; removed.
- The **spawn transient**: only spawning at exactly the wheel radius is
  stable. Spawning 2 mm clear leaves the robot still descending 0.1 s
  later (0.25 s contact time constant, 11.8 mm overshoot); spawning at the
  settled depth throws it 85 mm in the air.

**Unverified / open:**
- **Check 1 is half done.** MuJoCo's yaw efficiency across μ is measured;
  **the Gazebo half was not**, because it needs a world variant per μ and
  `full_world_robo.launch.py` has no `world` argument while
  `coco_world.world` is do-not-touch. **The 0.70–1.45 question is
  unanswered.** Recommendation recorded (narrow the friction
  distribution rather than widen the gain range) but **not acted on**.
- **`refit.py`'s `solref` lever is disconnected** — three values return
  bit-for-bit identical scores, caught by `coco_sim.sweep`. The accepted
  calibration is **not reproducible from the committed harness** (1.211 vs
  the recorded 1.170), and `solimp = 0.9` scores better than the fitted
  0.5. Re-fit with all levers verified before reusing those numbers.
- Non-monotonicity of yaw efficiency in μ is **rate-dependent** and at
  0.50 rad/s, μ = 1.5 the sign inverts. **Hypothesis (labelled): mostly a
  solver artefact** — halving the timestep cuts the high-friction end by a
  third while leaving the low end alone, and a physical optimum does not
  move with the integrator.
- `mujoco_env` still has no acceleration limit; left alone deliberately so
  Phase 1.5's steady-state numbers stay valid. Unify in Phase 3.
- Nothing was trained. Deck traverse open-loop is 0/17, 3/9, 0/8.

**Next:**
Phase 3 — the classical baselines, per `docs/M7_PHASES.md`. Re-fit the
contact calibration first, with every lever asserted connected.

```bash
sed -n '/## Phase 3/,/^```$/p' ~/ros2_ws/src/coco-robot-ros2/docs/M7_PHASES.md
